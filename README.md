# Airport Based Restaurants

This repository contains a copy of the Airport Based Restaurants from 
data from Google Maps of [Airport Restaurants](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1ESeubCk9sDWafBt8iQ4dzXu97tftJBQ&hl=en&ehbc=2E312F&fbclid=IwAR0pxghD-9-qjVp166ebeCYMnEOpqAXOfqoKARUX1Tr5rWK2F8bplGpDelg&ll=48.50138401582604%2C-109.82212150000001&z=4).

The orignal was imported from an KML format and converted to
 a *ForeFlight* **content pack** that can easily imported in ForeFlight.

As an example, this is how the restaurants are shown over Florida, once
the content pack is importanted and selected from maps.
