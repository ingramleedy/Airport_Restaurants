# Airport Based Restaurants

This repository is for pilot's using the electronic flight bag (EFB) [ForeFlight](https://www.foreflight.com/) app and contains a *content pack* copy of the Airport Based Restaurants from 
Google Maps data from [Airport Restaurants](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1ESeubCk9sDWafBt8iQ4dzXu97tftJBQ&hl=en&ehbc=2E312F&fbclid=IwAR0pxghD-9-qjVp166ebeCYMnEOpqAXOfqoKARUX1Tr5rWK2F8bplGpDelg&ll=48.50138401582604%2C-109.82212150000001&z=4).

# What are ForeFlight Content Packs
ForeFlight *content packs* allow organizations and individuals to create and import bundles of related content that can be accessed in the app, making it easier to adapt ForeFlight to a variety of specialized uses.
See [ForeFlight Content Pack Overview](https://www.foreflight.com/products/foreflight-mobile/user-content/content-packs) and [ForeFlight Content Pack Support](https://foreflight.com/support/content-packs/).

# Airport Restaurant Content

We all love a mission to fly somewhere to eat that is on location of an airport or just nearby
walking distance.  This *content pack* provides a directory of airport restaurants viewable as waypoints on the ForeFlight map page.  This allows you to research and plan your destination around food.

The orignal was imported from an KML format and converted to
 a *ForeFlight* **content pack** that can easily imported in ForeFlight.

As an example, this is how the restaurants are shown over Florida, once
the content pack is imported and selected from maps.

## Use and Importing into ForeFlight 

For instructions on how to download and import the Content Packs into
Foreflight (**recommended**), please browse the `contentpacks`
directory of this repository and download/share them into the
app. Detailed instructions about how to import Content Packs into
Foreflight are available at their [support
page](https://www.foreflight.com/support/content-packs/) (search for
"Importing Content Packs").


## History and Future 

* Version 1.0 is a working concept.  Content Packs allow offline content to 
downloaded while without Internet connectivity.  

* A future version may add an additional offline *Profile* page with pictures, 
addresses, and links to Google Maps for pictures, reviews, and menus 
(for when you do have Internet connectivity).

* Need an automated way to keep content up-to-date from the source(s) and to build the *content pack* automatically.

* Need a way to push the up-to-date *content pack* directly to ForeFlight. 

## ForeFlight Feature Request

Keeping this content up-to-date requires updating the content pack contents 
and then re-downloading the content pack and re-importing if you want the 
latest changes.  

* I have asked ForeFlight for a feature to allow content packs to be downloaded
directly and updated from a URL. Currently you can download from a URL, but 
ForeFlight does not keep the content up-to-date on changes.

Another method is to add to your cloud storage for Performance Plus 
subscribers of ForeFlight, by adding a folder named 
*contentpacks* to the root folder and place your content packs in
the folder. This will make the content packs available to download and update
automatically (assuming you put a new content pack in the shared folder).

* Currently ForeFlight only allows one cloud provider. This solution could be
improved to allow multiple cloud drive storage providers. 

Pilots may need access to multiple resources, companies, flight schools, 
flight clubs, 3rd party content, etc. I envision a subscription service that
provided valuable content on various contant that would currate and 
keep up-to-date.
